Ant Simulation Project by Guillaume Martinet and Lucas Tittmann
under GNU GPL v3
is a project to simulate a colony of ants, represented in simple OpenGL 3D.

Check out the latest version at Github: https://github.com/Andarin/Ant_Simulation

With this file you can change:
1. Display resolution
2. Duration of the simulation
3. Board size
4. Control parameters of your colony

Use with caution and only change the numbers. Don't make spaces behind or in
front of the numbers. There is a security copy in case you broke this file
called "Ant_Sim_parameters_copy.txt"

1. Display resolution
SCREEN_WIDTH
960
SCREEN_HEIGHT
640

2. Duration of the simulation in seconds
PLAY_TIME (standard is 600)
600

3. Board size in millimeters
BOARD_SIZE (standard is 5000)
5000

4. Control parameters of your colony
COLONY_POSITION_X (should be between 100 and BOARD_SIZE-100; standard is 200)
200
COLONY_POSITION_Y (should be between 100 and BOARD_SIZE-100; standard is 200)
200
COLONY_REPRODUCTION_SPEED_PER_MINUTE (standard is 30)
# attention! at the moment, the simulation is very calculation intensive,
# therefore be careful when increasing this value, it can get slow fast
150
COLONY_INITIAL_FOOD (standard is 1000)
1000
ANT_SPEED (in meter per second; standard is 0.1)
0.1
LARVA_DEVELOPPEMENT_TIME (in seconds; standard is 20)
# how long does an ant need after creation to become adult
# attention! the colony needs larvas to transform solid food into liquid food
# adult ants and the queen eat only liquid food
