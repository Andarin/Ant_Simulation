Ant Simulation Project by Guillaume Martinet and Lucas Tittmann
under GNU GPL v3
is a project to simulate a colony of ants, represented in simple OpenGL 3D.

Check out the latest version at Github: https://github.com/Andarin/Ant_Simulation

With this file you can change:
1. Display resolution
2. Duration of the simulation
3. Board size
4. Control parameters of your colony

Use with caution and only change the numbers. Don't make spaces behind or in
front of the numbers. There is a security copy in case you broke this file
called "Ant_Sim_parameters_copy.txt"
